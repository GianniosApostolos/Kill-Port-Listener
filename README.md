# Kill-Port-Listener

### Find any application id listening to a user specified network port and decide whether to terminate it or not.

A simple console application made for this exact reason. It executes cmd commands to both find and terminate the application.  

I made this application because I constantly have to shutdown programs that listen to specific ports and typing those cmd commands, almost always, feel like a dull task. If you find yourself at the same position then this program is for you


Download it from the releases tab or click [here](https://github.com/GianniosApostolos/Kill-Port-Listener/releases) and run the **_.exe_** file. 

I have used visual studio 2022 and .net7 to create this application so keep that in mind if you wish to edit the project files. 

###### If you can't launch the application try launching in admin mode or downloading the latest .net version for your windows.
###### Might release the application files in older .net version in the future.

### Have fun!
