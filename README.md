# Kill-Port-Listener

Find any application id listening to a specific port and decide whether to terminate it or not.

A simple console application made for this exact reason. Download it from the releases tab and run the **_.exe_** file.

I have used visual studio 2022 and .net7 to create this application so keep that in mind if you wish to edit the project files.

### Have fun!
